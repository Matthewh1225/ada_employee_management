# Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Completed

### ✅ A Option: Heterogeneous Container using Inheritance (100 points)

**Implementation Complete:**
1. **Stack Allocation** - All storage allocated once on the stack using the Box1.adb pattern:
   - `Employees : Employee_Array` (1..1000)
   - `Cars : Car_Array` (1..1000)
   - `Planes : Plane_Array` (1..1000)
   - `Departments : Department_Array` (per Job_Type)

2. **Inheritance Hierarchy:**
   ```ada
   type Transport_Record is abstract tagged record ...
   type Car_Info is new Transport_Record with record ...
   type Plane_Info is new Transport_Record with record ...
   ```

3. **No Heap Memory** - Zero use of `new`, `malloc`, or dynamic allocation

4. **Sorted Output:**
   - Ascending by job type
   - Descending by job type
   - Within each job: sorted by age, then name

5. **Traditional File I/O** - Uses Ada.Text_IO for reading Cars.txt

**Program:** `employee_manager.exe`

### ✅ C Option: Generic Vehicle System (Used Car Sales)

**Implementation Complete:**
1. **Generic Package:**
   ```ada
   generic
      type Job_Type is (<>);           -- Manufacturer
      type Model_Type is (<>);         -- Model
      Max_Age : Positive := 10;        -- Doors
      Max_Vehicles_Value : Positive := 1000;
      Max_Name_Length : Positive := 32;
   package Generic_Vehicle_System is
   ```

2. **Stack Allocation for Head Nodes:**
   - `Vehicles : Vehicle_Array` (1..Max_Vehicles)
   - `Departments : Department_Array` (per Job_Type)

3. **Instantiation for Cars:**
   ```ada
   type Car_Manufacturer is (Ford, Chevrolet, Dodge, GMC);
   type Car_Model is (Expedition, Raptor, Camaro, ...);
   
   package Car_Sales_System is new Generic_Vehicle_System
     (Job_Type => Car_Manufacturer,
      Model_Type => Car_Model,
      Max_Age => 10,  -- max doors
      Max_Vehicles_Value => 1000,
      Max_Name_Length => 32);
   ```

4. **Processes B Option Data:**
   - Reads Cars.txt
   - Treats Manufacturer as "job type"
   - Treats Doors as "age"
   - Treats Model as vehicle type

5. **All Sort Specifications:**
   - Ascending by manufacturer (job type)
   - Descending by manufacturer
   - Within each: sorted by doors (age), then name

**Program:** `car_sales_manager.exe`

## How to Build and Run

```powershell
# Build both programs
cd d:\Schoolwork\testing_ada
alr build

# Run A Option
.\bin\employee_manager.exe

# Run C Option
.\bin\car_sales_manager.exe
```

## Key Files

### A Option Files:
- `src/Employee_System.ads/adb` - Main system with stack allocation
- `src/Transportation.ads/adb` - Vehicle inheritance hierarchy
- `src/employee_manager.adb` - Driver program
- `src/ProcessFile.ads/adb` - File reading
- `src/Enums.ads` - Enumerations

### C Option Files:
- `src/Generic_Vehicle_System.ads/adb` - Generic package
- `src/Car_Sales_Manager.adb` - Instantiation and driver

### Shared Files:
- `Cars.txt` - Test data
- `employee_manager.gpr` - Project file

## Test Results

### A Option Output Sample:
```
Employees by job (ascending):
Department: ACCOUNTANT
Name: Sable, Age: 26
  Vehicle: GMC PICKUP with 2 doors in WHITE

Department: ANALYSIST
Name: Kevin, Age: 23
  Vehicle: FORD EXPEDITION with 5 doors in BLUE
...
```

### C Option Output Sample:
```
===== VEHICLE LIST BY MANUFACTURER (ASCENDING) =====

=== Manufacturer: FORD (4 vehicles) ===
  Vehicle: Expedition
    Manufacturer: FORD
    Model: EXPEDITION
    Doors: 4
...
```

## Technical Highlights

1. **Zero Heap Allocation** - Everything on stack, real-time ready
2. **Type Safety** - Strong typing prevents mixing incompatible data
3. **Generic Reusability** - C Option can be instantiated for different types
4. **Efficient Sorting** - Maintained during insertion, O(n) per insert
5. **Robust Parsing** - Handles varying whitespace and formats
6. **Clear Separation** - A and C options are independent implementations

## Compliance Matrix

| Requirement | A Option | C Option |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| Stack allocation | ✅ | ✅ |
| No heap/new/malloc | ✅ | ✅ |
| Inheritance | ✅ | N/A |
| Generic/template | N/A | ✅ |
| User-specifiable ranges | N/A | ✅ |
| Head nodes on stack | ✅ | ✅ |
| Traditional file I/O | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sorted ascending | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sorted descending | ✅ | ✅ |
| Processes data to EOF | ✅ | ✅ |

## Grade Target

- **A Option:** Maximum 100 points
- **C Option:** Demonstrates advanced generic programming with stack allocation
- Both options fully functional and tested
